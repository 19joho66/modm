\page getting_started Getting Started

To get started go to the root folder an run <tt>$ scons update</tt>. Then go to the 
src folder and run <tt>$ scons</tt>. Now the library and all the unittests shoulb
get build. If everything is set up correctly you should get a output like:

\verbatim
Passed 520 tests
OK!
\endverbatim

Looks like everything is running just fine ;-)
