\section tool_configfile_provides Provided builders and methods

\subsection tool_configfile_find FindFiles(path [, unittest, ignore])

Search for every useable source file in this folder and its subfolders (except
.svn folders).
If one folder contains the configuration file \c build.cfg, then it and it's
subfolders are only included into the search if the current architecture
matches the target-option in this file.

More about this in the page about \ref configuration_files "configuration files".

The returned object Provides the following attributes:
	- sources:	list of source files
	- header:	list of header files
	- defines:	dictionary with defines needed by the source files

TODO check if the next paragraph is true

Folders named \c test are special folders. If \c unittest = True
only test folders are included in the search. If \c unittest = False all folders
named test are excluded. If \c unittest = None tests are handled like normal
folders.

Files listed in ignore are not included into the result.
