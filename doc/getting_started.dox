\page getting_started Getting Started

To get started go to the root folder an run <tt>$ scons update</tt>. Then go to the 
unittest folder and run <tt>$ scons</tt>. Now the library and all the unittests shoulb
be build.

If you're compiling for the pc just use <tt>$ scons run</tt> to build 
and run the unittests. You should get a output like:

\verbatim
Passed 437 tests
OK!
\endverbatim

Looks like everything is running just fine ;-)
