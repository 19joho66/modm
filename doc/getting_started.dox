\page getting_started Getting Started

To get started go to the root folder an run <tt>$ scons update</tt>. Then go to the 
src folder and run <tt>$ scons</tt>. Now the library and all the unittests shoulb
get build. If you're compiling for the pc there should get a output like:

\verbatim
Passed 437 tests
OK!
\endverbatim

Looks like everything is running just fine ;-)

For every other target the program will only be build but not executed.
