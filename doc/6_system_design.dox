\page system_design 6. System Design

System design recommends and works with a special structure for the application.
Sometimes restrictions are kept strong in order not to make implementation complex
and sometimes they are kept so, in order to constrain the developer to keep the
application well structured.

A special structure of software in a project is recomended in order to use more
features of XPCC.
TODO: describe samples, possibilities and requirements of System Design.

System design defines not only restrictions for code, but also implements many

System design provides:
- possibilities to describe the system by xml files
- generating source and header files from xml.
