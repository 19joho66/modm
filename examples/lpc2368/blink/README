This is a development board with an LPC2368 in TQFP100. It 
features USB connection, RTC, Ethernet, CAN, RS232, RS422, RS485, 
piezo speaker, SD card slot, LEDs push buttons, potentiometers and
an LCD connector. The crystal frequency is 12 MHz. 

Flash Command
-------------
~/rca/lpc21isp/lpc21isp -wipe build/blink.hex /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 12000

Results as of 2012-06-10
-------
The processor starts the external oscillator. A 12 MHz signal can be observed
at the crystal. It then initialises the PLL and runs at 72 MHz. 
After a long delay (about 5 seconds) the LEDs P3.25 and P3.26 start flashing. 
P3.26 is on for 900msec and then P3.25 is on for 100msec. 

Knwon Issues
------------
The device takes very long to start up because in low_level_init.sx a 
long loop at the beginning of _lowLevelInit.
